        <h2 class= "mainheader-aboutus">Edible Plants</h2>
        <p1 class="tipstext">-Choose the right location: Most edible plants need plenty of sunlight, so choose a location that gets at least six hours of direct sunlight per day. Make sure the soil is well-drained and rich in nutrients.
          <br><br>-Start with quality soil: Good soil is essential for healthy plants. Invest in quality soil or amend your existing soil with organic matter like compost, aged manure or worm castings to improve its nutrient content and texture.
          <br><br>-Water properly: Most edible plants require regular watering, especially during hot, dry weather. Water deeply, but don't over-water, as this can lead to root rot.
          <br><br>-Choose the right plants for your climate: Not all plants will thrive in all climates. Choose plants that are well-suited to your local growing conditions to maximize your chances of success.
        </p1>

        <h2 class= "mainheader-aboutus">Flowers</h2>
        <p1 class="tipstext">-Consider the height and spacing requirements of different flowers. Some flowers grow tall and require support, while others need to be planted close together for a fuller effect.
          <br><br>-Water flowers regularly, being careful not to over-water or underwater them. The amount of water required can vary based on the flower species and weather conditions.
          <br><br>-Fertilize flowers as needed, using a balanced fertilizer or one that is specifically formulated for flowering plants. Follow the package instructions for best results.
          <br><br>-Consider adding some annuals to your garden for a burst of color and variety. Annuals bloom for one season and can be replaced each year.
          <br><br>-Deadhead spent blooms to promote new growth and extend the flowering season. This can also help keep the plants looking neat and tidy.
        </p1>

        <h2 class= "mainheader-aboutus">Soil/Mulch</h2>
        <p1 class="tipstext">-Test the soil periodically to monitor nutrient levels and pH. Adjust the soil as needed to ensure the plants have the nutrients they require.
          <br><br>-Choose the right soil for your plants. Different plants have different soil requirements, so it's important to select the appropriate soil type. Some plants prefer well-draining soil, while others require more moisture retention.
          <br><br>-Avoid over-fertilizing, which can harm the plants and contribute to nutrient runoff into water sources.
          <br><br>-Apply mulch to a depth of 2-4 inches, being careful not to cover the base of the plants. Too much mulch can suffocate the plants and prevent proper growth.
          <br><br>-Apply a layer of mulch around plants to help retain moisture and suppress weeds. Mulch can also regulate soil temperature and provide a neat appearance.
          <br><br>

      <div class="column2">
        <h2 class= "mainheader-aboutus">Decorative Plants</h2>
        <p1 class="tipstext">-Consider the amount of sunlight and shade in your garden. Different plants have different requirements for light, so it's essential to plant them in the appropriate spot.
          <br><br>-Prune regularly to remove dead or damaged branches and promote healthy growth. This can also help maintain the shape and size of the plants.
          <br><br>-Consider using containers or raised beds to grow decorative plants. This can be a good option for small spaces or for plants that require specific growing conditions.
          <br><br>-Add variety to your garden by using plants with different textures, colors, and shapes. This can create an eye-catching display and provide interest throughout the year.
          <br><br>-Keep the plants well-watered, but don't over-water them. Too much water can drown the plants and cause root rot, while too little can cause them to dry out and die.
        </p1>

        <h2 class= "mainheader-aboutus">Tools</h2>
        <p1 class="tipstext">-Invest in quality tools. Good tools can last for years and make gardening tasks easier and more efficient.
          <br><br>-Choose tools that are appropriate for your gardening tasks. Different tools are designed for different tasks, such as digging, pruning, or weeding. Make sure to select the right tool for the job.
          <br><br>-Store tools properly to protect them from the elements and prevent damage. Hang them up or store them in a dry, covered area.
          <br><br>-Wear gloves to protect your hands from cuts, blisters, and thorns. This is especially important when handling thorny plants or sharp tools.
          <br><br>-Use tools safely and follow the manufacturer's instructions. This can prevent accidents and ensure that the tools are used effectively.
